# Hamming

Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.

A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or
copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are
vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect
throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very
rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,
the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated
result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.

The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point
mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.

By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands
taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of
the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the
evolutionary path between the two strands.

This is called the 'Hamming distance'.

It is found by comparing two DNA strands and counting how many of the
nucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string.

The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

# Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so
an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should
not work. The general handling of this situation (e.g., raising an
exception vs returning a special value) may differ between languages.

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/elm) for Elm
installation and learning resources.

## Writing the Code

The first time you start an exercise, you'll need to ensure you have the
appropriate dependencies installed. Thankfully, Elm makes that easy for you and
will install dependencies when you try to run tests or build the code.

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

Automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the test suite, be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
